## Data Analysis Lifecycle

-  Importing data: how do we get data into R
-  Wrangling data: how do we clean and prepare data
    -  Tidying data: how do we structure data for analysis
    -  Transforming data: how do we manipulate and summarize data
-  Visualization: how do we explore data and communicate results
-  Modeling: how do we quantify relationships in data (not a focus of this course)
-  Communication: how do we share results with others

# But first...

## Show and tell {.smaller}

::: task
-   Form a small group (2-4 people) with people sitting around you

-   First, introduce yourselves to each other -- name (and proper pronunciation of name), year, major, where are you from, etc.

-   Start with the bad graphs -- Share your examples of "bad" graphs and why you think they're bad.

-   Then, share your good graphs -- Same deal, share your examples of "good" graphs and why you think they're good.

-   Finally, choose the **one** plot from your group that you think is most striking, either because it's bad or because it's good, and have one team member share the graph on #general in Slack in the relevant thread.

## Lectures {.smaller}

-   In person

-   Attendance is required

-   A little bit of everything:

    -   Traditional lecture
    -   Live coding + demos
    -   Short exercises + solution discussion

-   Recordings will be posted after class -- to be used for review + make-up if you can't make it to class due to health reasons, they're not an alternative to class attendance

## Labs

-   Attendance is required

-   Opportunity to work on course assignments with TA support

-   Opportunity to work with teammates on projects

## Announcements

-   Posted on Canvas (Announcements tool) and sent via email, be sure to check both regularly

-   I'll assume that you've read an announcement by the next "business" day

## Diversity and inclusion {.smaller}

It is my intent that students from all diverse backgrounds and perspectives be well-served by this course, that students' learning needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity that the students bring to this class be viewed as a resource, strength and benefit.

-   If you have a name that differs from those that appear in your official Duke records, please let me know!

-   Please let me know your preferred pronouns.

-   If you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by your experiences outside of class, please don't hesitate to come and talk with me. I want to be a resource for you. If you prefer to speak with someone outside of the course, your advisers and deans are excellent resources.

-   I (like many people) am still in the process of learning about diverse perspectives and identities. If something was said in class (by anyone) that made you feel uncomfortable, please talk to me about it.

## Accessibility

-   The [Student Disability Access Office (SDAO)](https://access.duke.edu/students) is available to ensure that students are able to engage with their courses and related assignments.

-   I am committed to making all course materials accessible and I'm always learning how to do this better. If any course component is not accessible to you in any way, please don't hesitate to let me know.

# Assessments

# Course policies

## Late work policy {.smaller}

-   Reading quizzes: Late submissions not accepted

-   Homework assignments:

    -   Late, within 24 hours of deadline: -10% of available points

    -   Late, within 24-48 hours of deadline: -20% of available points

    -   More than 48 hours later: No credit, and we will not provide written feedback

-   Project presentations: Late submissions not accepted

-   Project write-ups:

    -   Late, within 24 hours of deadline: -10% of available points

    -   Late, within 24-48 hours of deadline: -20% of available points

    -   More than 48 hours later: No credit, and we will not provide written feedback

-   Peer evaluation:

    -   Late submissions not accepted
    -   Must turn in peer evaluation if you want your own score from others

## Collaboration policy

-   Only work that is clearly assigned as team work should be completed collaboratively (Projects)

-   Reading quizzes must be completed individually, you may not discuss answers with teammates, clarification questions should only be asked to myself and the TAs

-   Homework assignments must be completed individually. You may not directly share answers / code with others, however you are welcome to discuss the problems in general and ask for advice

## Sharing / reusing code policy

-   We are aware that a huge volume of code is available on the web, and many tasks may have solutions posted

-   Unless explicitly stated otherwise, this course's policy is that you may make use of any online resources (e.g. RStudio Community, StackOverflow, etc.) but you must explicitly cite where you obtained any code you directly use or use as inspiration in your solution(s)

-   Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism, regardless of source

## Use of generative artificial intelligence (AI) {.smaller}

-   Treat generative AI, such as ChatGPT, the same as other online resources.

-   Guiding principles:

    -   \(1\) *Cognitive dimension:* Working with AI should not reduce your ability to think clearly. We will practice using AI to facilitate—rather than hinder—learning.

    -   \(2\) *Ethical dimension***:** Students using AI should be transparent about their use and make sure it aligns with academic integrity.

-   **✅ AI tools for code:** You may make use of the technology for coding examples on assignments; if you do so, you must explicitly cite where you obtained the code. See the syllabus for guidelines for citing AI-generated content.

-   **❌ AI tools for narrative:** Unless instructed otherwise, you may not use generative AI to write narrative on assignments. In general, you may use generative AI as a resource as you complete assignments but not to answer the exercises for you.

## Academic integrity

> To uphold the Duke Community Standard:

> -   I will not lie, cheat, or steal in my academic endeavors;
> -   I will conduct myself honorably in all my endeavors; and
> -   I will act if the Standard is compromised.

## 

<br><br><br>

::: {.large .hand style="text-align: center"}
most importantly:

ask if you're not sure if something violates a policy!

## Wellness

I want to make sure that you learn everything you were hoping to learn from this class. If this requires flexibility, please don't hesitate to ask.

-   You never owe me personal information about your health (mental or physical) but you're always welcome to talk to me. If I can't help, I likely know someone who can.

-   I want you to learn lots of things from this class, but I primarily want you to stay healthy, balanced, and grounded.

# Course Tools

## RStudio

::: {.large style="text-align: center;"}
<https://cmgr.oit.duke.edu/containers>
:::

-   Browser based RStudio instance(s) provided by Duke OIT

-   Requires internet connection to access

-   Provides consistency in hardware and software environments

-   Local R installations are fine but we will not guarantee support

## GitHub {.smaller}

::: {.large style="text-align: center;"}
<https://github.com/vizdata-s24>
:::

-   GitHub organization for the course

-   All of your work and your membership (enrollment) in the organization is private

-   Each assignment is a private repo on GitHub, I distribute the assignments on GitHub and you submit them there

-   Feedback on assignments is given as GitHub issues, scores recorded on Sakai Gradebook

::: task
Fill out the *Getting to know you* survey for collection of your account names, later this week you will be invited to the course organization.
:::

## Username advice {.smaller}

::: hand
in case you don't yet have a GitHub account...
:::

Some brief advice about selecting your account names (particularly for GitHub),

-   Incorporate your actual name! People like to know who they're dealing with and makes your username easier for people to guess or remember

-   Reuse your username from other contexts, e.g., Twitter or Slack

-   Pick a username you will be comfortable revealing to your future boss

-   Shorter is better than longer, but be as unique as possible

-   Make it timeless. Avoid highlighting your current university, employer, or place of residence

## Slack {.smaller}

-   Online forum for asking and answering questions

-   Private repo in the course organization

-   You will need to join the course organization for access

-   Ask **and answer** questions related to course logistics, assignment, etc. here

-   Personal questions (e.g., extensions, illnesses, etc.) should be via email to me

-   Once you join, browse the channels to make sure you're posting questions in the right channel, update your profile with your name, photo/avatar of you that matches your GitHub profile, and your pronouns

-   **Unfortunately** Slack is **not** the best place to ask coding questions, but it's a great place for real-time connection and collaboration

::: task
Demo on Tuesday for asking good questions with proper code formatting.
