# Introduction to R

## What is R? {.smaller}

-  R is a statistical programming language
    +  Inspired by the S programming language developed at Bell Labs in the 1970s
    +  Created by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman at the University of Auckland, New Zealand in the early 1990s for teaching statistics
    +  Now one of the most popular programming languages for data science and statistics
-  R is free and open source
    +  Anyone can download and use R for free
    +  Anyone can contribute to the development of R and its packages

## R is not the same as R Studio, R Markdown, or Positron {.smaller}

-   R is the programming language
-   R Studio (now Positron) is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R
    +   Provides a user-friendly interface for writing and running R code

# Working with R

## Writing Scripts in R

- Let's open up a script and run some R code!
    + Running R from the console
    + Running R from a script file

## R Packages {.smaller}

- R has a rich ecosystem of packages that extend its functionality
    + You can install packages using `install.packages("package_name")` (only do this once)
    + Load packages into your R session using `library(package_name)` (do this every time you start a new R session)
- An important package for this class:
    + `tidyverse`: A collection of packages for data manipulation, visualization, and modeling
        + `ggplot2`: A package for creating graphics using the Grammar of Graphics
        + `dplyr`: A package for data manipulation
- Let's install and load `tidyverse`

## Palmer Penguins Dataset

- Install the `palmerpenguins` package
- Contains dataset on the famous Palmer Penguins:
 penguin species, island in Palmer Archipelago, size (flipper length, body mass, bill dimensions), and sex.
- Explore more with `?penguins`

## Important Vocabulary {.smaller}

-  **Data frame**: A table-like structure in R that holds data (`penguins`)
    + In the `tidyverse` data frames are referred to as `tibbles`
-  **Variable**: is a quantity, quality, or property that you can measure (e.g. `species`, `bill_length_mm`, `island`)
-  **Observation** or **Data point**: a single object that has been measured (e.g. one of the penguins in the data set)
-  **Value**: the entry for a particular variable and observation (e.g. for the first penguin, the value of `species` is "Adelie", the value of `bill_length_mm` is 39.1)
-  **Tabular Data**: data organized in rows and columns (like a spreadsheet or data frame)
-  **Tidy Data**: tabular data where each observation is a row, and each type of observational unit forms a table

## Taking a quick look at `penguins`

- `glimpse` gives a quick overview of the data frame
- `head` shows the first few rows of the data frame
- `tail` shows the last few rows of the data frame
